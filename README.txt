This project was started to get familiar with building a datastructure (in this case Binary Trees), 
with the extension of solving problems that uses this datastructure.

BinaryTree class is the main class, which builds the binary tree, using Node class.
MaxPathSum is an additional class for solving the max sum problem in binary trees.

TODO: Make binary tree generator and implement MaxPathSum
